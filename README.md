### (2016 Pizarro) : [**Automated Quality Assessment of Structural Magnetic Resonance Brain Images Based on a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00052/full) Frontiers in Neuroinformatics

One of the first to apply a **machine learning (SVM) algorithm** in the quality assessment of structural brain images, using global and region of interest (ROI) automated image quality features developed in-house. The performance (accuracy) of the automated SVM approach was assessed, by comparing the SVM-predicted quality labels to investigator-determined quality labels. For classifying 1457 3D-MRI volumes from our database using the SVM approach, the **accuracy is 80%**. These results are promising and illustrate the possibility of using SVM as an automated quality assessment tool for 3D-MRI.
